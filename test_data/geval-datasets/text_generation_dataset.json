        "actual_output": "Once upon a time, a curious dog named Max wandered into the woods behind his house. As he sniffed around, he noticed something strange — the trees seemed to glow with an eerie light. Intrigued, he followed the glowing path and discovered a hidden, magical forest. The trees whispered ancient secrets, and the animals had the ability to speak. Max was amazed and spent the whole day exploring the enchanted forest, making new friends and uncovering secrets about the magical world around him.",

        "input": "Explain how a black hole is formed.",
        "actual_output": "A black hole is formed when a star with a mass significantly greater than that of the Sun runs out of fuel. As the star collapses under its own gravity, it creates an infinitely dense point called a singularity. The intense gravitational pull of the singularity prevents anything, including light, from escaping, which is why it appears black. The boundary around the black hole, beyond which nothing can escape, is called the event horizon.",
        "expected_output": "A black hole is created when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity. This collapse causes the core to become increasingly dense, ultimately forming a singularity. The gravitational pull near this singularity is so strong that not even light can escape, creating the characteristic 'black' appearance. The boundary around the black hole, known as the event horizon, marks the point beyond which no information can escape."

        "actual_output": "A rainbow is a beautiful arc of colors that appears in the sky after a rain shower. It is made up of seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are arranged in a specific order, with red on the outermost edge and violet on the inside. The rainbow often stretches across the sky in a vibrant curve, with its colors blending into each other, creating a mesmerizing effect.",
        "expected_output": "A rainbow is a multicolored arc that forms in the sky when sunlight interacts with rain droplets. It contains seven colors in a specific order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colors blend seamlessly from the outermost red to the innermost violet, creating a stunning and vibrant display across the sky."

        "actual_output": "The ocean's waves are soft and bright, A dance of colors in the light. It whispers secrets, old and deep, A world of wonder, where creatures sleep. The salty breeze that fills the air, The endless horizon, everywhere. A place of peace, so wild, so free, The ocean calls, come wander with me.",

        "input": "How do plants make their food?",
        "actual_output": "Plants make their food through a process called photosynthesis. Using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, plants create glucose, which is a type of sugar that provides energy. The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, allowing the plant to convert energy and produce food.",

        "input": "Describe the process of how a seed grows into a plant.",
        "actual_output": "A seed begins its journey by absorbing water from the soil. This process, called germination, causes the seed to swell and break open. The first root emerges and begins to anchor the plant into the soil. Then, the shoot emerges, pushing its way toward the sunlight. Over time, the shoot grows into a stem, and leaves begin to form, allowing the plant to start producing its own food through photosynthesis.",
        "expected_output": "When a seed is planted in the soil, it absorbs water and begins to germinate. The seed swells and cracks open, and the root grows downward into the soil. The shoot then pushes upward, seeking sunlight. As the plant continues to grow, leaves develop, allowing the plant to perform photosynthesis and produce energy."

        "input": "Explain what makes a rainbow appear after rain.",
        "actual_output": "A rainbow appears after rain because of the way sunlight interacts with the water droplets in the atmosphere. When sunlight passes through a droplet, it bends (or refracts), then reflects off the inside surface of the droplet, and finally bends again as it exits the droplet. This bending causes the light to split into its different colors, creating the spectrum of a rainbow.",
        "expected_output": "A rainbow forms when sunlight is refracted, reflected, and dispersed through water droplets in the atmosphere. As sunlight enters the droplet, it bends (refracts), reflects off the inside surface, and exits, splitting into the colors of the spectrum — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
